## Overview

Emerald Insights is a chatbot application engineered to provide detailed insights and visualisations based on user queries regarding specific datasets, such as the Irish historical electricity dataset. This application leverages cutting-edge technologies to deliver accurate and comprehensive data analysis. It uses Streamlit for the front-end and integrates advanced backend technologies such as LangChain, OpenAI, SQL, and Python agents for data processing and retrieval.

It features a SQL agent that interprets user queries to generate precise SQL statements, and a Python agent that translates SQL output into visualisation code, providing clear and informative graphical representations of the data. The application utilises natural language processing (NLP) to transform user queries into executable SQL and Python code, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience in data analysis and visualisation.

## Key Technologies and Techniques:

- LangChain: Orchestrates the chatbot workflow, integrating SQL and Python agents for seamless data interaction and processing.

- OpenAI: Utilizes the GPT-4 model for natural language understanding and response generation, enabling the chatbot to interpret and respond to user queries accurately.

- SQL and Python Agents:

  - SQL Agents: Generate and execute SQL queries against the system database for precise data retrieval.
  - Python Agents: Execute Python scripts to process data and create visualizations using matplotlib.

- Prompt Engineering:

  - Few-Shot Prompt Templates: Guide the language model in generating accurate SQL queries and responses.
  - System Message Templates: Define detailed instructions for handling various query types.

- Semantic Similarity Example Selector: Matches user queries with relevant examples to improve response accuracy.

## Example Code Insights:

- Database Connection: Connects to an SQLite database containing system data using the SQLDatabase utility.
- Sequential Chains: Combines SQL query execution and Python data processing for end-to-end data retrieval and visualization.
- Post-Processing: Formats responses from the language model for presentation in the Streamlit interface.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- See `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaM-92/ireland_res_chatbot
   ```

## Key Components

- `app.py`
  This is the main entry point of the application. It sets up the page configurations, navigation, and loads the respective pages based on user interaction.

- `pages/service_overview.py`
  Contains the overview of the service which is displayed on the "Service Overview" page.

- `pages/irish_data_chatbot.py`
  Contains the chatbot functionality to handle user queries about the Irish power system.

- `subs/`
  This directory contains various modules to support the application:
  - `agent.py`: Handles AI agents.
  - `db_connections.py`: Handles database connections.
  - `prompts.py`: Contains the templates and logic for generating prompts.
  - `styles.py`: Provides styles for the Streamlit application.
  - `visualisations.py`: Functions to visualize data in response to user queries.

### Data

The data is hosted on a PostgreSQL database.

For running the code locally, you can use the SQL database stored in the `data` folder under the name `eirgrid_data.db`. You also need to set `connect_to_irish_db(cloud=True)` to `connect_to_irish_db(cloud=False)` in the code.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure your pull requests are well-documented and tested. Adherence to coding standards, including the use of docstrings and comments, is encouraged.
